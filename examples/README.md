OSI Sensor Model Packaging Examples
===================================

The examples in this directory can be built using CMake.
They require that the open-simulation-interface submodule
of the repository is populated.

The OSMPDummySensor10 example shows how the OSMP definitions
could be mapped to FMI 1.0, however this is NOT part of the
specified standard, i.e. OSMP-compliant FMUs MUST be compliant
to FMI 2.0 or later.
